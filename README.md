# Fraction Slips

## About
I created this site for my child who is learning about fractions in 3rd grade. They use fraction slips on paper to help learn about the size of fractions visually. This is my digital version that has a similar function.

## Using the Site
You can visit [fraction-slips](https://fraction-slips.netlify.app) to get started. The app works by selecting your color. Then you click on the fraction that you want to highligh and it will turn that color. This is useful wehn comparing 2 fractions say, 1/2 and 3/5 and visually seeing which one is bigger.

## Tech Stack
I built this site using [Astro](https://astro.build), a React component on the client side, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS, and I deployed the site with [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
